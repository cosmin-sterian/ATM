An ATM server using TCP & UDP sockets to communicate with clients.

The TCP socket is used for the following commands:
	- login <card_no> <PIN code> - the client logs in with the specified card number and PIN code
	- logout - the client is logged out
	- listsold
	- getmoney <sum> - the client withdraws the specified sum(must be multiple of 10)
	- putmoney <sum> - the client deposits the specified sum

The UDP socket is used for the 'unlock' command, allowing the client to unlock his card using his secret password if the wrong PIN code was used three times in a row.
